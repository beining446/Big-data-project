The project investigates whether tomorrow will be a high-risk mental health day in Sydney  
based on today’s environmental and emotional signals.
## Files
- `data.csv` – processed dataset with daily observations (environmental and emotional features).  
- `model_c.py` – Python script that trains Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers  
  and prints evaluation results (Accuracy, F1, ROC-AUC, and feature importance).  
## Requirements

- Required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`
